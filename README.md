  <strong>ü™Ñ Turn text from documents and images into high-quality audio with one click. ‚ú® Convert articles, stories, and other content into clear speech for easy listening. üí° Ideal for students to practice listening and speaking skills by turning any text into natural-sounding audio.</strong>
</p>

## Overview

SpeakAI is an AI-powered web application that converts text from various sources ‚Äî including pasted text, uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT), or images ‚Äî into high-quality audio speech using advanced text-to-speech technology. It leverages OpenAI's TTS API for natural-sounding voices and supports concurrent processing for fast audio generation. The app features a user-friendly Gradio-based web interface and includes OCR capabilities for extracting text from images via OpenAI's Vision API.

## Features

- **Multi-Input Sources:** Accept text from:
  - Direct text input (paste your content)
  - File uploads (PDF, DOCX, TXT documents)
  - Images (JPG, JPEG, PNG) with automatic text extraction using AI vision
- **High-Quality Audio:** Generates lifelike speech using OpenAI's text-to-speech models
- **Multiple Voices:** Choose from 6 voice options: Female 1 (nova), Male 1 (alloy), Female 2 (fable), Male 2 (echo), Female 3 (shimmer), Male 3 (onyx)
- **Speed Control:** Adjustable playback speed from 50% (slower) to 200% (faster) for customized listening experience
- **Concurrent Processing:** Efficiently processes large texts by splitting into chunks and generating audio in parallel
- **Audio History & Archives:** Browser-based storage system using IndexedDB to save, load, rename, and delete previously generated audio files
- **Cost Estimation:** Real-time calculation and display of TTS API costs (approximately $15 per million characters)
- **Robust Text Handling:** Intelligently splits text at paragraph and sentence boundaries for natural pacing
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Gradio for an intuitive web experience with responsive design
- **API Integration:** Supports custom overlays for OpenAI and Vision API providers, plus Mr.üÜñ AI Hub integration
- **Persistent API Keys:** Browser localStorage stores your API keys for convenience across sessions
- **Error Resilient:** Includes retries, logging with Sentry, and comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Containerized Deployment:** Docker-ready with proper volume management for persistent data storage

## Requirements

- **API Keys:**
  - OpenAI TTS API key (set as `TTS_API_KEY` environment variable)
  - OpenAI Vision API key (set as `VISION_API_KEY` environment variable, required for image processing)
- **Python:** 3.12 or higher
- **Dependencies:** Managed via `uv` package manager

- **Documents:** PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), Text (.txt)
- **Images:** JPG (.jpg, .jpeg), PNG (.png)

## Configuration

Customize the application by setting these environment variables:

- `TTS_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for text-to-speech
- `VISION_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for vision/OCR
- `TTS_BASE_URL`: Custom base URL for TTS API (optional)
- `VISION_BASE_URL`: Custom base URL for Vision API (optional)
